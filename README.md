# Polybar Scripts

A personal collection of scripts that I use (or maybe don't) on my own machines to customise [polybar](https://polybar.github.io/). Some ideas were taken from the main [polybar-scripts](https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts) community repo.

Each subdirectory of the `scripts` dir contains the code and example polybar config to use the particular feature.

Hope you find some of them useful, would love to get your improvements or ideas!
